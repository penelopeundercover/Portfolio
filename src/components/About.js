          Becoming a web developer! I'm currently a student in a web development
          bootcamp. My current profession: dozer hand. I enjoy learning how
          things work, and how to make them work. It feels like I'm leaving one
          kind of construction and entering another. Different tools, different
          materials, but the same underlying mindset: make it work. When I first
          started construction, I was very booksmart but had no common sense
          whatsoever. I was challenged to use a whole different part of my
          mind--to think in a completely different way than ever before. And now
          I'm a Lead Operator. It's time to leave my comfort zone and challenge
          my mind yet again. I'm excited to see what contributions I can make to
          this new field.

          I am known as a dependable and positive person. I'm also a person who
          stays calm in crisis, while still performing with an appropriate sense
          of urgency. I live in a pretty little farming town in southeast Kansas
          called Fredonia with my husband and dog. I've been playing the piano
          since I was 8, have an unimpressive but helpful daily yoga routine,
          and enjoy reading the works of Jane Austen, John Donne, and A.W.Tozer.
          I also enjoy cooking, doing artsy projects with items I find in
          nature, and learning to do minor car repairs with the guidance of
          youtube.
